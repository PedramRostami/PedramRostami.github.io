About me
======
Hello! My name is Pedram Rostami. I am a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tehran, advised by Professors [Mohammad Javad Dousti](https://www.mjdousti.com/) and [Heshaam Feili](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=m5tCFEoAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I got my BSc in Computer Engineering at the Amirkabir University of Technology, where I was supervised by Prof. [Ehsan Nazerfard](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2384/EHSAN%20NAZERFARD).

My research focuses on Natural Language Processing, specifically Large Language Models and Machine Translation. I also explore techniques like Network Pruning and Quantization for compressing large models.
